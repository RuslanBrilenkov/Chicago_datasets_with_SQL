# Exploring_Chicago_datasets

In this project I am going to explore some of the Chicago public data sets. Namely, the Socioeconomic Indicators, Public Schools and Crime Data from Chicago Data Portal.

The goal is to use to get some insights and connect the data of Health & Human Services, Education and Public Safety.

These data sets could be found via the following links:

- Census Data - Selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago, 2008 â€“ 2012 (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)

- Chicago Public Schools - Progress Report Cards, 2011-2012 (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)

- Crimes - 2001 to Present (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2)
